While trying to flee persecution in China, Ayoob Mohammed, an Uyghur man,
found himself in Afghanistan when the U.S. invaded the country in response
to 9/11. Mohammed was among more than a dozen Uyghur men who were caught and
sold to the U.S. for bounty as an alleged terrorist, held for four years at Guantanamo Bay,
and finally exonerated. Still, 16 years after being released, he is still trying to prove he's innocent.
This story is exceptionally reported and told with nuance and empathy by Hylton,
who traces Mohammed's journey from his Uyghur homeland in northwest China to Guantanamo to Albania,
where he has since resettled - and continues to be a victim of politics among nations, a sacrifice to their interests.
Hylton examines the invisible geopolitical forces that have bent his story to their will and have
kept him from reuniting with his wife and their kids in Canada,
and also shows the challenges of long-term family separation through their story.
